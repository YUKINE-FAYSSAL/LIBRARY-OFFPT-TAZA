# Library of OFPPT Taza

This project is a library management system for OFPPT Taza, developed using **Laravel** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The system allows users to manage and borrow books, as well as for administrators to manage book inventory and user information.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built using **React**, this is the client-facing interface where users can search for books, borrow them, and view their borrowing history.
- **Backend**: Built with **Laravel**, providing the API that handles data management, authentication, and book management.

### Features:

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Book Management**: Admins can add, update, and remove books in the library.
- **Borrowing System**: Users can borrow books and view their borrowing history.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend is designed to be responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (for React)
- **PHP** (for Laravel)
- **Composer** (for PHP dependencies)
- **MySQL** or any other preferred database
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YUKINE-FAYSSAL/LIBRARY-OFFPT-TAZA.git
cd LIBRARY-OFFPT-TAZA
```

### 2. Set up the backend (Laravel)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install Laravel dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. Set up your environment file by copying the example:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Generate the application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. Set up the database configuration in the `.env` file (you can find your database credentials there).

6. Run the database migrations to set up your database:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

7. Seed the database with example data (optional):

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

8. Run the Laravel development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

   The backend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Set up the frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Test the application

- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React frontend.
- The React app will communicate with the Laravel backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Docker (Optional)

You can also use Docker to set up the environment more easily. If you prefer to use Docker, follow the instructions in the `docker` folder (if available) to build and run the application in a containerized environment.
